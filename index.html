<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scoreboard and challenge hosts will be available from anywhere on the internet for the duration of the CTF</li>
<li>Some challenges have automatically-created per-team hosts.
<ul>
<li>These hosts should be automatically created shortly after you register your team but may take a few minutes to fully initialize.</li>
<li>Domain names for these hosts will be automatically built with a unique "team-key" and displayed in associated challenge descriptions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>DONT BE A JERK!</b></li>
<li>No host discovery is required. Everyone scanning everything just makes the network break. Scanning a single host as part of a challenge is fine.</li>
<li>Targets are clearly marked, only attack those. No attacking the switches, networks, etc.</li>
<li>No DOS attacks, get the flags.</li>
<li>Don't mess with splunk and logging, we are just healthchecking.</li>
<li>If we ask, you need to show us what/how you did something.</li>
<li>Teams should be no larger than five players.</li>
<li>We aren't lawyers, you probably aren't a lawyer. Don't look for loopholes, just don't get in the way of other people having fun.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Random Thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>If this is your first CTF ever, you will be able to find things if you try, if it is not, we have challenges for you also.</li>
<li>Objectives and flags are fairly clearly marked.</li>
<li>No host discovery is required, but scanning a host may be useful.</li>
<li>Challenges are standalone, but some easier ones may give ideas for harder ones.</li>
<li>We are logging lots of things, if you aren't happy with that, don't play.</li>
</ul>
